# UbuntuCord
Discord engulfed with Ubuntu's font and square icons with a goal for smooth experience for reading and using Discord. <br />
This is a Discord custom CSS theme applied using [leovoel/beautifuldiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) <br />
You can install it for your Discord by running `beautifuldiscord --css /path/to/your/discord.css` <br />

### This is a short preview of the theme in screenshots. <br />
Close up of how fonts are rendered on Linux, they are no longer thin, for comparison take a look at the next picture down below. <br />
